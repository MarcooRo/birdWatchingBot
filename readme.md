<h1>Kanaria & Singular BOT</h1>
<p>Multi bot tools to observe the Kanaria and Singular markets in real-time</p>

<h2>What does it do</h2>
<p>The BOTs takes live events from the Kasuma blockchain, filtering remark::2.0.0 for Kanaria and, for the moment, remerk::1.0.0 for Singular. Each BOT has its own menu to create a filter and customize your feeds.</p>
  
<p>We have improved the experience by dividing the output into separate channels. In this way, it's possible to personalize your feed and keep it more organized. We developed this BOTs for Telegram and Discord.
